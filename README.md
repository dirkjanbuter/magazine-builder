## Web & Print

Our software exports content to HTML, eliminating the need for caching and ensuring a near-zero response time. Dynamic content is added through client-side scripting via a web API. Furthermore, the PDF output is optimized for printing at 300dpi, allowing you to directly print it with your preferred printing company.
